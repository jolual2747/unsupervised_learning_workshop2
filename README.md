# unsupervised_learning_workshop2

In this repository we are going to explore unsupervised machine learning methods for clustering, for this case will be KMeans and KMedoids
and those methods will be build from scratch in a python package.

Also, we are going to review and implement the silhoutte score and how to analyze it visually on plots to decide the optimal number of clusters to create in our data
